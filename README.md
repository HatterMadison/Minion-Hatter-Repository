# Basic How-To

* Where do I put X file?
  * Quest Profiles =  C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ffxivminion\QuestProfiles
  * ACR Profiles = C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines

* How do I change ACR profile I'm using?
  * MMOMinion Button -> FFXIVMinion Button -> ACR -> Select ACR Profile


## Quest Profile Info: (H) MSQ Endwalker v0.41
* What's new compared to previous version?
  * **Specialize Optimal Routing for Aether Currents & Mini-Aetheryte.**

  * This profile **Will collect Aether Currents and Mini-Aetheryte** when optimally on route for this specific Quest Profile route.
  * Within 'Quest Mode' -> 'Settings'  **Disable 'Gather Aether Current'** to allow this Quest Profile to do what it does.

  * **Better 'follow' quests parameters, Quest Profile will not reattempt failed 'follow' objectives.**
  * Bot will no longer tries to complete objective unless proper NPC is following.

* **Do not leave bot unattended while using this Quest Profile**
  * It has been tested few times throughly, confident is high, but, this is public resource. So no promises.

* **Complete EW MSQ up to level 83 Dungeons, Completes all unlocked Aether Current Quests** up to that point.
  * (Except for 1 in Labyrinthos, still deciding where on route Quest Profile should, I'm expecting it's later, not yet.

* There are currently 5 times the bot will stop for user to complete Duty/Dungeons.
  * 1. Snipe <Big Green Bird>
  * 2-5. Solo Duties & Dungeons
