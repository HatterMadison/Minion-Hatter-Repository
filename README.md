# Basic How-To

* Where do I put X file?
  * Quest Profiles =  C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ffxivminion\QuestProfiles
  * ACR Profiles = C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines

* How do I change ACR profile I'm using?
  * MMOMinion Button -> FFXIVMinion Button -> ACR -> Select ACR Profile


## Quest Profile Info: (H) MSQ Endwalker FINISHED
* **Do not leave bot unattended while using this Quest Profile**
  * That's just disclaimer, this been thoroughly tested. I aim for consistency after all. I always finish secondary test run of the profile before posting update.

* FINISHED VERSION,    ALL 108 MSQ,   ALL 24 ACQ,  Now Included with +4 Side Quests to unlock 90 Dungeons and etc.

* It does 1 Duty now, <As the Heaven Burns>.
  * I just realize I have no more character to take through EW. If I happen to get another character there, I'll complete the rest. (Except for Garlemald crawly crawly part, I'll just reach the battle circle of that duty)

* I gave up on Aether Current for now, the data is there, but it's just occasionally buggy due to way I implemented it outside of Quests. Will figure it out another time, I suggest just using QuestCore default or etc. AC Profile option is off by default now.
