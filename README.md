**Notice:** Most stuff requires **HatterLib**

## Basic How-To
* Place HatterLib folder in **LuaMods**, so the path looks like below.
  * HatterLib Path = **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\HatterLib**

* Where should X file go?
  * Quest Profiles =  **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ffxivminion\QuestProfiles**
  * ACR Profiles = **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines**

* How to change ACR profile?
  * **MMOMinion Button -> FFXIVMinion Button -> ACR -> Select ACR Profile**

## Finale Reaper ACR

*Casual Info:
 *It has a 'dynamic' mode which  auto-reserve and auto-destroy based on XYZ. This is my favorite part, that I hope to refine further. (This is not an auto-raid/timeline)

*Non-Casual Info:
 *Tries to sync with Devilment, Litany, Finishes. (If raid group is proper, this shouldn't be an hichup. If just casual content, this really shouldn't be an hichup)

 *Late weave Arcane Circle,  default Early Gluttony opener, option to perform Late Gluttony opener (don't turn on unless, you're confident, syncing buffs, etc.)

 *Double Enshroud, but, still refining, sometime 2nd Communio does not fit.   No triple enshroud yet, I have mixed feelings about that.

 *The other standards stuff, ensures Soul Gauge or Soul Slice is ready keep off CD Gluttony, True North only when advantageous, etc etc, this the boring stuff.

_Icon Folder Placement_
 **1.  Download Folder**
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1076ZUDnYh4hO2CvJmk1zoyMI1VKjdWwq?usp=sharing > 

**2. Place Downloaded Folder** 
in `C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\GUI`,   so the path of all the icons are   `C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\GUI\H_UI_Icons`



## Quest Profile Info: (H) MSQ Endwalker FINISHED
* **FINISHED VERSION,    ALL 108 MSQ,   ALL 24 ACQ,  Now Included with +4 Side Quests to unlock 90 Dungeons and etc.**

* **Do not leave bot unattended while using this Quest Profile**
  * That's just disclaimer, this been thoroughly tested. But dang. Bugs always appear anyway, I know that now. haha.

* It does **1 Duty** now, <**As the Heaven Burns**>
  * I just realize I have no more character to take through EW. If I happen to get another character there, I'll complete the rest. (Except for Garlemald crawly crawly part, I'll just reach the battle circle of that duty)

* It still doesn't do snipes yet. I don't wanna talk about it. :')

* I gave up on Aether Current for now, the data is there, but it's just occasionally buggy due to way I implemented it outside of Quests. Will figure it out another time, I suggest just using QuestCore default or etc. AC Profile option is off by default now.
