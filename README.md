All Class Unlocks: Fixed... so much stuff. tyty to person whom helped debug that. Unsung hero.


# Basic How-To

* Where should X file go?
  * Quest Profiles =  **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ffxivminion\QuestProfiles**
  * ACR Profiles = **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines**

* How to change ACR profile?
  * **MMOMinion Button -> FFXIVMinion Button -> ACR -> Select ACR Profile**


## Quest Profile Info: (H) MSQ Endwalker FINISHED
* **FINISHED VERSION,    ALL 108 MSQ,   ALL 24 ACQ,  Now Included with +4 Side Quests to unlock 90 Dungeons and etc.**

* **Do not leave bot unattended while using this Quest Profile**
  * That's just disclaimer, this been thoroughly tested. But dang. Bugs always appear anyway, I know that now. haha.

* It does **1 Duty** now, <**As the Heaven Burns**>
  * I just realize I have no more character to take through EW. If I happen to get another character there, I'll complete the rest. (Except for Garlemald crawly crawly part, I'll just reach the battle circle of that duty)

* It still doesn't do snipes yet. I don't wanna talk about it. :')

* I gave up on Aether Current for now, the data is there, but it's just occasionally buggy due to way I implemented it outside of Quests. Will figure it out another time, I suggest just using QuestCore default or etc. AC Profile option is off by default now.
