MSQ Profile does all Snipes, and 3x Duties. (missing Venat and In From Cold) (Also attempt fix all DM bugs)
ShB Dps Quest Profile does the 2x Duties.
Reapers' Quest Profile does the 2x Duties.

**Notice:** Most stuff requires **HatterLib**

## Basic How-To
* Place HatterLib folder in **LuaMods**, so the path looks like below.
  * HatterLib Path = **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\HatterLib**

* Where should X file go?
  * Quest Profiles =  **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ffxivminion\QuestProfiles**
  * ACR Profiles = **C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines**

* How to change ACR profile?
  * **MMOMinion Button -> FFXIVMinion Button -> ACR -> Select ACR Profile**

## Finale Reaper ACR

*Casual Info:
 *It has a 'dynamic' mode which  auto-reserve and auto-destroy based on XYZ. This is my favorite part, that I hope to refine further. (This is not an auto-raid/timeline)

*Non-Casual Info:
 *Tries to sync with Devilment, Litany, Finishes. (If raid group is proper, this shouldn't be an hichup. If just casual content, this really shouldn't be an hichup)

 *Late weave Arcane Circle,  default Early Gluttony opener, option to perform Late Gluttony opener (don't turn on unless, you're confident, syncing buffs, etc.)

 *Double Enshroud, but, still refining, sometime 2nd Communio does not fit.   No triple enshroud yet, I have mixed feelings about that.

 *The other standards stuff, ensures Soul Gauge or Soul Slice is ready keep off CD Gluttony, True North only when advantageous, etc etc, this the boring stuff.

_Icon Folder Placement_
 **1.  Download Folder**
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1076ZUDnYh4hO2CvJmk1zoyMI1VKjdWwq?usp=sharing > 

**2. Place Downloaded Folder** 
in `C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\GUI`,   so the path of all the icons are   `C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\GUI\H_UI_Icons`



## Quest Profile Info: (H) MSQ Endwalker FINISHED
* **FINISHED VERSION,    ALL 108 MSQ,   ALL 24 ACQ,  Now Included with +4 Side Quests to unlock 90 Dungeons and etc.**

* **Do not leave bot unattended while using this Quest Profile**
  * That's just disclaimer, this been thoroughly tested. But dang. Bugs always appear anyway, I know that now. haha.

* It does **3 Duty** now, <**As the Heaven Burns**> <**Endwalker**> <**Frosty Reception**>>

* All snipes completed thanks to <HereToPlay>

* Custom Route for Aether Current, trying to be efficient.
